I'm using [WinDV](http://windv.mourek.cz/ "WinDV") to digitalize all recorded video material from a vintage MiniDV-handycam via Firewire. 
As WinDV saves every video shot in a different file, this project aims to detect shots that were taken on the same day.
Furthermore, it merges those clips to video files - one file for each day. Speaking of this project's future, it is planned to cut individual intros in front of each video containing the corresponding date and a description of the footage.
